## Humor \- A funny animation before you shutdown your windows


</div>

### Description

Don't worry, no shutdown is launched, just graphical and sound effects for fun.

Geek (as me) consider computer as they do with their own car : color themes changing, cleaning screen and keyboard every day, alarm ...

Alarm : You know the traditional sound of on/off alarm activating :

This source simply show a car glass running up and then, the alarm activating beep. After that, the screen become black in 3 secondes, ready to shutdown Windows if you code it.

Interesting parts :

- Simple way for transparency effects

- Sounds are stored in ressource file and played directly from memory (no intermediate file created)

Thanx for your comments.

Source comments are in french langage.

That's only for fun, but it make me laugh each time I launch this code.

Have fun (too) !
 
### More Info
 
This code use transparency effect.

So, it's NOT compatible with Windows 95, 98, Millennium, nor NT (sorry)
